# GWAS Workshop
A repository containing guides, gene expression data, and scripts for a Genome-Wide Association Study workshop.

This workshop performs three Genome-Wide Association Studies on endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 gene expression data collected by the 
Illumina microarray of HapMap3 individuals, having significant overlap with 1000 Genomes Project individuals. The association tests are performed with 
88 YRI (Yoruba in Nigeria) individuals and 102 CEU (Northern Europeans in Utah) from the 1KG project that pass quality control at the Centre 
for Applied Genomics. Analyses on the YRI, CEU, and combined CEU and YRI individuals are performed in order to demonstrate the intersection 
of statistics and genomics for interested students. The workshop focuses on using PLINK and R to perform association tests and to 
interpret their results. Statistical methods and considerations for genetic data, visualization and interpretation of large amounts of data, 
population stratification through principal component analysis, and reproducibility research are at the forefront of this workshop.
