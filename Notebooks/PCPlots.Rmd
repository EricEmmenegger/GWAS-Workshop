*This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.*

*Try executing this chunk by clicking the Run button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

### Steps
Below is the script to generate a plot of the principal components in R and save them as a .jpeg. Modify necessary file names and plot labels.

```{r}
kb = read.table(
  "PC.eigenvec",  
  header = FALSE, 
  sep = "", 
  fill = TRUE, 
  quote = ""
)

colnames(kb) = c("FID", "IID", "PC1", "PC2", "PC3")

jpeg("PC_plots.jpeg",width=1920,height=1920,units="px")
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

plot(kb$PC1,
     kb$PC2,
     main="Principal Components 1 and 2",
     xlab="PC1",
     ylab="PC2", 
     cex=3, 
     pch = 20)

plot(kb$PC1,
     kb$PC3,
     main="Principal Components 1 and 3",
     xlab="PC1",
     ylab="PC3", 
     cex=3, 
     pch = 20)

plot(kb$PC2,
     kb$PC3,
     main="Principal Components 2 and 3",
     xlab="PC2",
     ylab="PC3", 
     cex=3, 
     pch = 20)

dev.off()
```


### Default R Notebook Instructions


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
