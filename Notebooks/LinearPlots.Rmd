*This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.*

*Try executing this chunk by clicking the Run button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

### Steps

Generate the essential plots to visualize GWAS results. Modify all file paths and parameters. 

Load libraries and load data table containing GWAS results.
```{r}
library("qqman")

data <- read.table(
            "LRAP_CEU_YRI_bin_sex_test_clean.assoc.linear",
            header=TRUE,  
            sep = "", 
            fill = TRUE, 
            quote = ""
)
```

Generate a histogram.
```{r}
hist(as.numeric(data$P), 
     main="p-value distribution",
     xlab="p-Values",
     ylab="Frequency",
     breaks = seq(0,1,0.05),
     freq = TRUE, 
     cex = 3
     )
```

Generate a Manhattan Plot
```{r}
manhattan(data, 
          chr="CHR",
          bp="BP",
          p="P",
          snp="SNP", 
          main = "Manhattan plot"
          )
```

Generate a QQ-plot.
```{r}
qq(data$P, 
   main = "Q-Q plot"
   )
```




### Default R Notebook Instructions

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
